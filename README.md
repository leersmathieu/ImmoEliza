# ImmoEliza

This is a first at BeCode, two teams from different backgrounds (WebDev & AI) come together to realize a project that is ambitious to say the least.

The duration of this project is one week.

Group 7 : Yannick (WebDev), Jonathan (WebDev), Mathieu (AI), Vincent (AI).

The github of the AI part : [ImmoEliza-API](https://github.com/leersmathieu/ImmoEliza-API)

## Result :

You can test our project here : http://tamikara.xyz/immo-eliza/prediction/

## Web development:

Our goal is to design an internal application for a real estate agency so that it can deduct a price for a certain type of dwelling according to different criteria. We develop this application in HTML, CSS, PHP, with integration of an API.

## AI:

Their goal is to design the API used for the application by developing a consistent set of data to return reliable values during the operation of the application.

## Step to realise (WebDev)
### 1. Form alpha

Create a first version of the form just to have an idea of the style.

### 2. CSS

Make the css of the app. Animate de form section on submit to make it disappear so the second section can appear. Find a good background and some icons.

### 3. API Call

Call the API using PHP to exploit the data provided by the API.

### 4. Make it flawless

Rework the whole so that it is functional, beautiful to the eye both in the design and in the code.

## Difficulties encountered

We have to coordinate two different teams (WebDev & AI) but they have common objectives, namely the application that is our goal.

We have to move forward without having all the elements at our disposal and for that we have to communicate between the two teams to know where we are heading.
